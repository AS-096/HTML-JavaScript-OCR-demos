# HTML-JavaScript-OCR-demos
## Just simple working demos of embeding different OCRs in a HTML website.


## 1. [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)

The first one I tried is Tesseract.js v4. It's really capable of recognizing printed words. It's also open source, completely free and could be used offline.
However, the image input needs to be very clear (not borders, lines or anything other than text), and it is not good at recognizing handwriting.

> Feel free to copy the code and use directly, or better add some styles.


## 2. [Pen to Print](https://www.pen-to-print.com/)

The other one I tried is Pen to Print. It's perfect for recognizing handwriting.
However, an [API key](https://rapidapi.com/serendi/api/pen-to-print-handwriting-ocr) is needed.
> Simply sign in (or sign up for) [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/serendi/api/pen-to-print-handwriting-ocr) and subscribe to any Pen to Print plan to get a key.
The documentation is very limited, and there's a hard limit of 100 calls per month without paying.
It takes me some time to make it work but it really works flawlessly.

> Feel free to copy the code, but remember to put in your API key.

**Hope these demos could be useful!**
